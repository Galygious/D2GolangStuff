I should add that many Rogue scouts 
have died in that horrible place. We 
cannot afford to lose any more. If you 
choose to enter that Den of Evil, you 
must do so alone.
`},
	},
	"A1Q1AfterInitCharsiAlt": {

You seem like a noble warrior. I hope 
you can help us.
`},

		{ID: 2179, Key: "A1Q1AfterInitCharsiMain", Value: `95
The beasts from the cave have begun to 
roam throughout the countryside. 
You'd better be careful out there.
`},
	},
	"A1Q1AfterInitGheed": {
		{ID: 762, Key: "A1Q1AfterInitGheed", Value: `67
You're a brave soul! I'd sooner thrust 
my sacred scepter into the foulest, 
carbuncular trull than set one boot 
into that cave.
`},
	},
	"A1Q1AfterInitKashya": {
		{ID: 4380, Key: "A1Q1AfterInitKashya", Value: `87
The demons in that cave have claimed 
many of my finest archers. I wonder 
how you will fare!
`},
	},
	"A1Q1AfterInitWarriv": {
		{ID: 1002, Key: "A1Q1AfterInitWarriv", Value: `122
One who seeks that cave, seeks death.
`},
	},
	"A1Q1EarlyReturnAkara": {
		{ID: 2019, Key: "A1Q1EarlyReturnAkara", Value: `85
Your task is not complete until you have 
killed all the demons in that cave.
`},
	},
	"A1Q1EarlyReturnCharsi": {
		{ID: 1568, Key: "A1Q1EarlyReturnCharsi", Value: `148
You haven't cleared the cave, yet? Do 
you need anything?
`},
	},
	"A1Q1EarlyReturnGheed": {
		{ID: 4538, Key: "A1Q1EarlyReturnGheed", Value: `73
Demons still befouling that cave, huh? I 
think you might need a new weapon.
`},
	},
	"A1Q1EarlyReturnKashya": {
		{ID: 517, Key: "A1Q1EarlyReturnKashya", Value: `111
You'd better come through on this. Your 
reputation depends on it.
`},
	},
	"A1Q1EarlyReturnWarriv": {
		{ID: 4056, Key: "A1Q1EarlyReturnWarriv", Value: `124
One who hesitates... does so with good 
reason.
`},
	},
	"A1Q1InitAkara": {
		{ID: 478, Key: "A1Q1InitAkara", Value: `43
There is a place of great evil in the 
wilderness. Kashya's Rogue scouts 
have informed me that a cave nearby is 
filled with shadowy creatures and 
horrors from beyond the grave.
 
I fear that these creatures are massing 
for an attack against our encampment. 
If you are sincere about helping us, 
find the dark labyrinth and destroy the 
foul beasts.
 
May the Great Eye watch over you.
`},
	},
	"A1Q1SuccessfulAkara": {
		{ID: 4433, Key: "A1Q1SuccessfulAkara", Value: `65
You have cleansed the Den of Evil. 
You've earned my trust and may yet 
restore my faith in humanity.
 
Your reward is training in the skill of 
your choice.
`},
	},
	"A1Q1SuccessfulCharsi": {
		{ID: 2831, Key: "A1Q1SuccessfulCharsi", Value: `94
You are truly brave and skillful...  Akara 
was worried about you.
`},
	},
	"A1Q1SuccessfulGheed": {
		{ID: 3506, Key: "A1Q1SuccessfulGheed", Value: `87
The only good demon is a dead one, I 
say.
 
By the way, did you happen to find 
anything in that cave you'd like to sell?
`},
	},
	"A1Q1SuccessfulKashya": {
		{ID: 3972, Key: "A1Q1SuccessfulKashya", Value: `74
Hmm. I'm surprised you survived that 
test, outlander. Go see Akara. She may 
reward you.
`},
	},
	"A1Q1SuccessfulWarriv": {
		{ID: 4610, Key: "A1Q1SuccessfulWarriv", Value: `120
...That which does not kill you makes 
you stronger.
`},
	},
	"A1Q2AfterInitAkara": {
		{ID: 2457, Key: "A1Q2AfterInitAkara", Value: `51
Blood Raven fought valiantly against 
Diablo in the catacombs beneath 
Tristram... She was never quite the 
same afterwards. It is now obvious she 
brought an evil influence back with her.
`},
	},
	"A1Q2AfterInitCharsi": {
		{ID: 4358, Key: "A1Q2AfterInitCharsi", Value: `99
Blood Raven was the leader of a Rogue 
band that once fought Diablo at 
Tristram.
`},
	},
	"A1Q2AfterInitGheed": {
		{ID: 1018, Key: "A1Q2AfterInitGheed", Value: `94
I'm sorry... The undead are bad for 
trade. I have a strict no-return policy.
`},
	},
	"A1Q2AfterInitKashya": {
		{ID: 3083, Key: "A1Q2AfterInitKashya", Value: `80
Death has done nothing to weaken 
Blood Raven's combat skills. If 
anything, she's more deadly than ever.
`},
	},
	"A1Q2AfterInitWarriv": {
		{ID: 5098, Key: "A1Q2AfterInitWarriv", Value: `140
Hmmm...
 
How can one kill what is already dead?
`},
	},
	"A1Q2EarlyReturnAkara": {
		{ID: 1199, Key: "A1Q2EarlyReturnAkara", Value: `70
If you fail to destroy Blood Raven, I fear 
that our Order will perish forever.
`},
	},
	"A1Q2EarlyReturnCharsi": {
		{ID: 3177, Key: "A1Q2EarlyReturnCharsi", Value: `68
Akara felt something was wrong even 
before Andariel descended upon us. 
She feared that Blood Raven had 
stumbled upon some evil force beneath 
Tristram.
 
I wish we had acted then...
`},
	},
	"A1Q2EarlyReturnGheed": {
		{ID: 1605, Key: "A1Q2EarlyReturnGheed", Value: `77
I wonder if that old gossip, Melra, is 
among the undead? Oh, she had dirt on 
everybody.
`},
	},
	"A1Q2EarlyReturnKashya": {
		{ID: 2126, Key: "A1Q2EarlyReturnKashya", Value: `99
Each moment you delay adds another 
undead Sister to Blood Raven's army.
`},
	},
	"A1Q2EarlyReturnWarriv": {
		{ID: 272, Key: "A1Q2EarlyReturnWarriv", Value: `86
When the dead return to prey upon the 
living, it is a terror beyond 
understanding.
`},
	},
	"A1Q2InitKashya": {
		{ID: 4561, Key: "A1Q2InitKashya", Value: `56
My Rogue scouts have just reported an 
abomination in the Monastery 
graveyard!
 
Apparently, Andariel is not content to 
take only our living. Blood Raven, one 
of our finest captains in the battle 
against Diablo at Tristram, was also 
one of the first to be corrupted by 
Andariel.
 
Now, you'll find her in the Monastery 
graveyard raising our dead as 
zombies!
 
We cannot abide this defilement! If you 
are truly our ally, you will help us 
destroy her.
`},
	},
	"A1Q2SuccessfulAkara": {
		{ID: 337, Key: "A1Q2SuccessfulAkara", Value: `122
Andariel must be made to pay for her 
sacrilege!
`},
	},
	"A1Q2SuccessfulCharsi": {
		{ID: 3651, Key: "A1Q2SuccessfulCharsi", Value: `77
Kashya wishes to reward you for your 
defeat of Blood Raven. I thank you, 
too, even though Blood Raven was once 
my friend.
`},
	},
	"A1Q2SuccessfulGheed": {
		{ID: 2209, Key: "A1Q2SuccessfulGheed", Value: `148
Some of those gals weren't so nice the 
first time around.
`},
	},
	"A1Q2SuccessfulKashya": {
		{ID: 4792, Key: "A1Q2SuccessfulKashya", Value: `55
I can hardly believe that you've defeated 
Blood Raven!
 
Though she was once my closest friend, 
I pray that her tortured spirit remains 
banished forever.
 
You have earned my respect, stranger... 
and the allegiance of the Rogues. I 
have placed several of my best 
warriors at your disposal.
`},
	},
	"A1Q2SuccessfulWarriv": {
		{ID: 37, Key: "A1Q2SuccessfulWarriv", Value: `104
You've done well, stranger. I hope all 
your efforts are worth it.
`},
	},
	"A1Q3AfterInitAkara": {
		{ID: 2201, Key: "A1Q3AfterInitAkara", Value: `59
The retrieval of the Horadric Malus is 
not without risk. Our Monastery is 
filled with voracious hellspawn. You'd 
best be careful, my friend.
`},
	},
	"A1Q3AfterInitCain": {
		{ID: 226, Key: "A1Q3AfterInitCain", Value: `51
The Malus was forged and enchanted by 
the ancient Horadric Mages during the 
Sin Wars. When their union dissolved, 
the Malus was entrusted to the 
Sisterhood guarding the pass into the 
East.
`},
	},
	"A1Q3AfterInitCharsi": {
		{ID: 262, Key: "A1Q3AfterInitCharsi", Value: `87
The Monastery can confuse even those 
who know it well. Stay alert in there.
`},
	},
	"A1Q3AfterInitGheed": {
		{ID: 1277, Key: "A1Q3AfterInitGheed", Value: `74
Charsi talks of nothing anymore, but 
this Horadric Malus. Between you and 
her my ears need a rest.
 
Just find it and bring it back quickly.
`},
	},
	"A1Q3AfterInitGheedAlt": {
		{ID: 582, Key: "A1Q3AfterInitGheedAlt", Value: `74
I have offered my nomadic phallus, but 
to no avail.
`},
	},
	"A1Q3AfterInitKashya": {
		{ID: 1581, Key: "A1Q3AfterInitKashya", Value: `61
Charsi is wasting her time and talents 
using an inferior hammer! Had she the 
Horadric Malus, she could make the 
steel sing and craft you a suit of armor 
as impenetrable as the Great Eye.
`},
	},
	"A1Q3AfterInitWarriv": {
		{ID: 3596, Key: "A1Q3AfterInitWarriv", Value: `68
Just as an archer needs bow and arrow, 
or a draughtsman pen and paper, so 
Charsi needs the Horadric Malus with 
which to ply her trade.
`},
	},
	"A1Q3EarlyReturnAkara": {
		{ID: 379, Key: "A1Q3EarlyReturnAkara", Value: `98
If you can't carry out this quest, how 
will you face the greater evils ahead?
`},
	},
	"A1Q3EarlyReturnCain": {
		{ID: 4225, Key: "A1Q3EarlyReturnCain", Value: `57
The Malus has eluded you so far. Well, 
search thoroughly in the Barracks... 
That is where the Rogues kept their 
forge.
`},
	},
	"A1Q3EarlyReturnCharsi": {
		{ID: 843, Key: "A1Q3EarlyReturnCharsi", Value: `89
The Malus is a Horadric artifact of 
great power. Please bring it back.
`},
	},
	"A1Q3EarlyReturnGheed": {
		{ID: 785, Key: "A1Q3EarlyReturnGheed", Value: `90
I have heard that you bear us no Malus.
`},
	},
	"A1Q3EarlyReturnKashya": {
		{ID: 5185, Key: "A1Q3EarlyReturnKashya", Value: `71
To do battle with Andariel requires 
more than thick skin and a strong will. 
You'll want armor and weaponry forged 
with the hammer's enchantments.
`},
	},
	"A1Q3EarlyReturnWarriv": {
		{ID: 3331, Key: "A1Q3EarlyReturnWarriv", Value: `120
What better opportunity to show your 
mettle?
`},
	},
	"A1Q3InitCharsi": {
		{ID: 5275, Key: "A1Q3InitCharsi", Value: `66
When I fled the Monastery, I left behind 
the Horadric Malus, my enchanted 
smithing hammer. If you can retrieve it 
for me, I'll use its magic to strengthen 
your equipment.
`},
	},
	"A1Q3SuccessfulAkara": {
		{ID: 1224, Key: "A1Q3SuccessfulAkara", Value: `57
Well done, my friend. But remember, the 
return of the Horadric Malus is but one 
step in reclaiming the Monastery.
`},
	},
	"A1Q3SuccessfulCain": {
		{ID: 1049, Key: "A1Q3SuccessfulCain", Value: `59
The magical effects imbued by the 
Malus are impossible to predict, but 
are always to the good.
`},
	},
	"A1Q3SuccessfulCharsi": {
		{ID: 245, Key: "A1Q3SuccessfulCharsi", Value: `72
Oh! Thanks so much for returning the 
Horadric Malus! I will now imbue one of 
your items with magical powers.
`},
	},
	"A1Q3SuccessfulGheed": {
		{ID: 1322, Key: "A1Q3SuccessfulGheed", Value: `120
I guess it's too late to take back some 
of the names I called you.
`},
	},
	"A1Q3SuccessfulKashya": {
		{ID: 3499, Key: "A1Q3SuccessfulKashya", Value: `74
Now that the Horadric Malus is back in 
our possession, we shall use it to 
deliver a great blow against the Evil 
which torments this land.
`},
	},
	"A1Q3SuccessfulWarriv": {
		{ID: 4137, Key: "A1Q3SuccessfulWarriv", Value: `118
I am glad the hammer has returned and 
you with it.
`},

		{ID: 954, Key: "A1Q4AfterInitScrollAkara", Value: `42
Tristram is too far to journey by foot...  
Cain would likely be dead, when you 
arrived. However, there is a magical 
portal that will take you there 
instantly.
 
To open it, one must stand within the 
circle of Cairn Stones and touch them 
in a certain order. The proper order 
can be found in the runes written on 
the bark of the Tree of Inifuss.
 
You must find the sacred Tree of Inifuss 
and bring back its bark. I will translate 
the runes to unlock the Stones' mystic 
pattern.
`},
	},
	"A1Q4AfterInitScrollCharsi": {
		{ID: 465, Key: "A1Q4AfterInitScrollCharsi", Value: `117
If you bring back the bark of Inifuss, 
Akara will tell you how to get to 
Tristram.

Regrettably, I could do nothing to 
prevent the disaster which devastated 
Tristram. It would appear that our 
greatest fears have come to pass. 
Diablo, the Lord of Terror, has once 
again been set loose upon the world!
 
As you know, some time ago Diablo was 
slain beneath Tristram.  And when our 
hero emerged triumphant from the 
labyrinth beneath town, we held a 
grand celebration that lasted several 
days.
 
Yet, as the weeks passed, our hero 
became increasingly aloof. He kept his 
distance from the rest of the townsfolk 
and seemed to lapse into a dark, 
brooding depression. I thought that 
perhaps his ordeal had been so 
disturbing that he simply could not put 
it out of his mind.
 
The hero seemed more tormented every 
passing day. I remember he awoke 
many times -- screaming in the night -- 
always something about 'the East'.
 
One day, he simply left. And shortly 
thereafter Tristram was attacked by 
legions of foul demons. Many were 
slain, and the demons left me to die in 
that cursed cage.
 
I believe now that Tristram's hero was 
that Dark Wanderer who passed this 
way before the Monastery fell.
 
I fear even worse, my friend... I fear 
that Diablo has taken possession of the 
hero who sought to slay him. If true, 
Diablo will become more powerful than 
ever before.
 
You must stop him or all will be lost.

It is certain that we face the demon 
queen, Andariel, who has corrupted the 
Rogue Sisterhood and defiled their 
ancestral Monastery. This does not 
bode well for us, my friend.
 
Ancient Horadric texts record that 
Andariel and the other Lesser Evils 
once overthrew the three Prime Evils -- 
Diablo, Mephisto and Baal -- banishing 
them from Hell to our world. Here, they 
caused mankind untold anguish and 
suffering before they were finally 
bound within the Soulstones.
 
Andariel's presence here could mean 
that the forces of Hell are once again 
aligned behind Diablo and his Brothers. 
If this is true, then I fear for us all.
 
You must kill her before the Monastery 
becomes a permanent outpost of Hell

Apparently, certain Horadric funereal

Staff.
 
To do it - use the Cube as you would a

both pieces of the Staff into it and use 
the Cube's transmute power.
 
You'll be pleased to know that the Cube 
has other alchemical uses as well...
 
Six gems plus one sword transmute into 
a socketed long sword.
 
You may also transmute two quivers of 
crossbow bolts into one quiver of 
arrows, while two quivers of arrows 
yield one quiver of bolts.

Ahh... The lost Horadric Scroll! What a

As the last living Horadrim, I alone have 
knowledge of its meaning. Now, to read 
the Horadric runes it bears. Hmmm...
 
The Horadric Mages, after binding Baal 
within Tal Rasha, magically sealed off 
his Burial Chamber from the mortal 
realm. Those same Mages also crafted 
fearsome Horadric Staves and imbued 
them with the special power to open 
the Chamber's hidden door.
 
After nearly losing one to the thievery 
of a rogue sorcerer, they divided all 
the Horadric Staves into two parts - 
wooden shaft and metal headpiece - 
hiding them separately to safeguard 
them.
 
The Horadrim foresaw our current 
plight and designed the hiding places 
to reveal themselves to worthy heroes 
like you.
 
Collect both parts of a Horadric Staff 
and unite them using a Horadric Cube. 
Then, you may enter Tal Rasha's Burial 
Chamber.

Place the Staff into the receptacle you 
find there. That will open the secret

I very much doubt that Horazon still

Nearly a thousand years ago, Horazon 
rose to the fore of the Vizjerei mage 
clan. Horazon used the knowledge of 
the Vizjerei to summon and control 
demons from Hell.
 
Though a powerful Summoner, Horazon 
feared that the Lords of Hell would 
punish him for enslaving their 
brethren. Thus, the Summoner created 
for himself an Arcane Sanctuary.
 
He believed that his Sanctuary would 
not only protect him from Hell's 
vengeance, but also allow him to 
continue his studies free from the 
ravages of time and disease.
 
Horazon had crafted many wondrous 
scrying devices through which he 
observed the events of the world 
outside. It is certain that he took 
careful study of Tal Rasha's 
imprisonment and recorded the 
location of his forgotten Tomb.
 
The Arcane Sanctuary was believed to 
have been constructed here in Lut 
Gholein. An entrance may be hidden 
somewhere in the palace, as that 
building is very old, and was once a 
Vizjerei fortress.

Ah, the ancient mage Horazon! He 
believed that he could bend Evil forces 
to his will. What he didn't know was 
that Evil uses man, not the reverse.
 
The Vizjerei still revere him as a symbol

worldly forces. The Church of Light, 
however, cites him as an example of 
man's folly.

When the troubles began here, I allowed 
the terrified Harem guilds to join me 
within the safety of the palace. All was 
fine, until one night...
 
Screams echoed up the stairwells from 
the harem. My guards arrived to find 
the poor girls being slaughtered by a 
merciless band of hell-spawned 
demons. My brave guardsmen tried to 
push the demons back into the 
mysterious rift from which they came.
 
Ever since, my men have fought a losing 
battle. Demons have continued to pour 
through the rift into the palace. 
Ultimately, I hired Greiz and his 
mercenaries to help protect the rest of 
my fair city.
 
Drognan believes that the Arcane 
Sanctuary lies buried underneath this 
palace, since Lut Gholein occupies the 
site of an ancient Vizjerei fortress.
 
My palace is open to you now... Take 
care.

ancient seals over a passageway in the 
cellar, he became very agitated. He 
asked for some time alone to study 
them, and I granted it.
 
Shortly after, he left with no further 
word and I never saw him again. Odd... 
Don't you think?

I've been researching the old records, 
trying to find the location of Tal 
Rasha's Tomb. Though I haven't found 
the Tomb, itself, I may have a good 
lead for you.
 
The great Vizjerei Summoner, Horazon, 
built his Arcane Sanctuary somewhere 
around here. He was a powerful 
spellcaster and kept demons as slaves 
within the Sanctuary. He kept a close 
eye on great events, too -- such as the 
imprisonment of Baal within Tal 
Rasha's Tomb.
 
If you could find Horazon's Sanctuary, 
I'm sure that it would hold some clue 
as to the Tomb's location. Though I 
doubt Horazon is still alive, you must 
proceed with caution. There's no telling 
what could be waiting inside.
 
When I spoke of this with Lord Jerhyn, 
he asked that I send you to him. 
Perhaps he knows of a secret entrance 
or the like.

Seekers of the Tomb of Tal Rasha will 
find it through the Portal. But know 
that the glowing glyphs recorded here 
in my Arcane Sanctuary are the signs 
of the six False Tombs.
 
The missing Seventh Sign marks the 
Tomb of Tal Rasha... Of the Horadrim 
he might be called the foremost.
 
It was a shining - but brief - moment for 
the Mage Clans when they set aside 
their differences and worked together 
against the common enemy.
 
The Horadrim relentlessly pursued the 
Three across the desolate Empires of 
the East, and even into the uncharted 
lands of the West, leaving the 
Archangel Tyrael's hands unblemished.
 
Presuming the Three to be vanquished, 
the Horadrim's unstable fellowship 
began to dissipate. Abandoning their 
sacred charge to safeguard the three 
Soulstones, the disparate Mage Clans 
began to squabble amongst each other 
over petty differences.
 
Their conflicts not only dissolved their 
brotherhood, but strengthened the 
Evils which they had buried beneath the 
cold earth.

The appearance of the mage you

Tristram. Many Vizjerei came to fight 
against Diablo, the Lord of Terror. 
Perhaps, this is one of them.

Yes... The man you speak of sounds like 
the mage who came here many months 
ago. He claimed to have fought Diablo 
in the passages beneath Tristram.
 
No doubt the fool wandered into 
Horazon's Sanctuary and lost whatever 
was left of his ravaged mind. He is 
beyond salvation. 
 
It is possible that the fool has been 
possessed by the spirit of Horazon. If 
that's true, then you'd better put an 
end to his tortured existence.
 
Once done, I believe the demons who 
were summoned and imprisoned within 
the Sanctuary will cease to exist as 
well.

shortly after that. I wonder how he got 
down there? The seal was never

The Archangel Tyrael was the one who

It is highly unusual for the forces of 
Heaven to so directly interfere with 
man's destiny, but Tyrael was said to 
act of his own volition. We have never 
been able to discern why.
 
Perhaps, he goes against the consensus 
of Heaven because he doubts our 
ability to defend ourselves, or perhaps, 
he sees more threat than his peers.
 
Where the actions of Hell often seem 
straightforwardly bent on destruction, 
the motives of Heaven are 
unfathomable.
 
Now make haste... Both Diablo and Baal 
must be stopped before they join with 
their brother, Mephisto. If the three

There is a very special book which you 
must find for me. It was written long 
ago by a sage known as Lam Esen, who 
studied Skatsimi magic and the effects 
of the Prime Evils on the mortal world. 
The Black Book was lost when the 
Children of Zakarum took over this

Never forget that your ultimate purpose 
here in Kurast is to destroy Mephisto. 
The ancient Horadrim imprisoned the 
Lord of Hatred inside the Guardian 
Tower that is located within the Temple 
City of Travincal.
 
Know this, friend. The only way to gain 
entry to Mephisto's prison is to destroy 
the artifact known as the Compelling 
Orb.
 
Mephisto used this device to control the 
Zakarum Priests and their followers. 
The Orb can only be destroyed with an 
ancient flail imbued with the spirit of 
the one incorruptible priest.
 
Soon after his imprisonment, Mephisto 
worked his evil corruption on the 
Zakarum priesthood. All were turned to 
his dark ways, save one - Khalim, the 
Que-Hegan of the High Council.
 
Mephisto directed the other Council 
priests to slay and dismember Khalim 
and then scatter his remains across 
the Kingdom. The Priest Sankekur 
succeeded Khalim as Que-Hegan, 
eventually becoming the embodiment of 
Mephisto here on the mortal plane.
 
The corrupted High Council fashioned 
an Orb to control the rest of the 
Zakarum faithful and used their powers 
to hide the lair of their master from 
mortals.
 
Your task is to collect the scattered 
relics of Khalim - his Heart, his Brain, 
and his Eye. Then, using the Horadric 
Cube, transmute Khalim's Flail with his 
relics.
 
Once this is accomplished, you must 
destroy the Compelling Orb with 
Khalim's Will to open the way into the 
corrupt sanctum of Mephisto.

one who can use the Gidbinn to protect 
us.

You have done well, my friend. Your 
courage and valor are an inspiration to 
us all.
 
But now the time has come to face 
those responsible for the evil that has 
stifled our land. You must destroy the 
High Council of Zakarum!
 
Long ago, these elders were charged 
with the stewardship of Mephisto, the 
Lord of Hatred, who was imprisoned 
within the Guardian Tower.
 
Through the generations, these pious 
men slowly fell more and more under 
the sway of Mephisto's malevolent 
power and the Council became an evil 
mockery of its former glory. 
 
It is Mephisto's Hatred that has 
corrupted Zakarum and turned its 
devout followers into paranoid 
fanatics. That is why you must travel 
to the Temple City of Travincal and 
slay the Council.
 
Once they are gone, Mephisto's hold 
over this land and its people will be 
broken!

The ancient Horadrim always feared

Mephisto, along with Baal, was 
originally captured in the desert near 
Lut Gholein. But imprisoning two of the 
Brothers together was far too 
dangerous.
 
The Horadrim built the Guardian Tower 
to hold Mephisto. When Zakarum came 
to power in this land, it took over the 
Temple City without paying any heed to 
what was locked within the Tower.
 
And it became their doom.

men, and in ages past he was my most 
trusted Lieutenant.
 
Yet, against my wishes he led an 
ill-fated assault upon the fiery 
Hellforge, itself.
 
Despite his valor and strength, Izual 
was captured by the Prime Evils and 
twisted by their perverse power. They 
forced him to betray his own kind and 
give up Heaven's most guarded 
secrets.
 
He became a corrupt shadow of his 
former self - a fallen angel trusted 
neither by Heaven nor Hell.
 
For his transgressions, Izual's spirit 
was bound within the form of a terrible 
creature which was summoned from 
the Abyss. His maddened spirit has 
resided within that tortured husk for 
many ages now.

The plan we set in motion so long ago

Izual helped Diablo and his Brothers 
trick me into using the Soulstones

Kashya has always been fiercely loyal,

generations, has been corrupted by the

Judging from his dress and strange 
markings, I would guess that Ormus is 
from the ancient Taan mage-clan. Yet 
none of the others here seem to know 
that he is a sorcerer.
 
The Taan were once as powerful as the 
Vizjerei clan, but their studies were 
even more secretive. I wonder what 
he's hiding.

Have you met, Natalya? She appears to

centuries... almost as long as the 
Horadrim, itself.
 
Her presence here makes me uneasy, 
for they are traditionally sworn to hunt 
down Magi who have betrayed the trust 
of their order.
 
I wonder why she is here.

I have read much about the enigmatic 
Archangel Tyrael. He was revered in 
Horadrim lore both for his compassion 
for mortals and his unquenchable 
spirit.
 
It was rumored that he went against the 
wishes of Heaven and gave the 
Horadrim the original Soulstones in 
order to trap Diablo and his Brothers.

Can you believe this place? Did you ever 
dare to dream that you'd one day 
stand upon the crossroads between 
Heaven and Hell? This Pandemonium 
Fortress is truly miraculous.
 
However, your journey is not yet over. 
Diablo still roams free in Hell, 
marshalling his demonic forces. Only 
when he is beaten will our world finally 
have peace.
 
Hurry now... the sands of time slow for 
no one!

Long ago, the Soulstones were given to 
the Horadrim by the Archangel Tyrael. 
They were used to bind the three Prime 
Evils. I now know that even these holy 
artifacts were no match for Diablo's 
power.
 
I hope that his two brothers are more 
securely held... but I fear the worst.

Have I told you about the Horadrim? 
They were an ancient confederation of 
mage-clans who sought to bind the 
three Prime Evils for eternity. The 
Horadrim are now nearly forgotten... 
and it appears that the bonds they 
wove are unravelling!
 
As the last of the Horadrim, I pray that 
I can help you remedy their failure.

Long ago, Diablo and his brothers were

as Andariel is now aligned with the 
Lord of Terror. Her presence here in 
the mortal realm does not bode well for 
us.

You know, I've been with the Sisters for 
as long as I can remember. But Akara 
told me that my real parents were 
Barbarians from the northern tribes 
and that they were killed when I was 
very young.
 
Sometimes I wonder what my life would 
have been like if I had been raised as a 
Barbarian.
 
I don't know. I love being a blacksmith... 
but sometimes I just want to get out 
and explore the world, you know?

Hi there. I'm Charsi, the blacksmith here

adventurers around here.
 
Many of our Sisters fought bravely 
against Diablo when he first attacked 
the town of Tristram. They came back 
to us true veterans, bearing some 
really powerful items. Seems like their 
victory was short-lived, though... Most 
of them are now corrupted by Andariel.

The Horadrim were a powerful Order,

Not long ago, one of my Vizjerei

quite insane, so I dismissed much of 
what he said.

him since. I fear that fool may have

When the recent troubles began, Lord

Welcome to Kurast, traveler. Few come 
willingly to this ancient city anymore. I 
hope you brought your wits with you, 
for sanity is in short supply here.
 
My name is Hratli. I am a sorcerer 
skilled in metal work. It'd be a pleasure 
to help you... I don't have many 
customers these days.
 
As you can see, the populace has been 
brutally decimated by the forces of 
Mephisto. The canals run red with 
blood and demons roam the land.
 
The wretched jungle-hell has already 
reclaimed much of Kurast. The only 
safety you'll find is here at the 
dockside, where a magical warding 
holds the jungle evils at bay... but I 
don't know how long it will last.
 
To make matters worse, the Children of 
Zakarum are in league with the forces 
of Mephisto. The Zakarum have 
concentrated their power in the Temple 
City of Travincal, located within Kurast 
deep in the jungle wilderness.
 
It's true... Their zeal is unmatched. But I 
say the so-called 'Warriors of Light' are 
nothing more than the twisted puppets 
of a hidden hand.

Greetings, honored traveler. I am 
Jerhyn, Lord of Lut Gholein, and I bid 
you welcome to my fair port-city. I'm 
glad to know that once again caravans 
are free to travel through the Western 
Pass.
 
For some time now, we have been under 
siege by an evil power that I cannot 
identify. Strange... It all began when a 
Dark Wanderer came this way, looking 
for the Tomb of Tal Rasha. No one 
knows exactly where Tal Rasha, Keeper 
of Baal, is entombed, but it is certain 
to be far out in the desert.
 
Now, my people whisper tales of the 
dead rising from their tombs and 
horrible creatures lurking amongst the 
moonlit dunes. Even I have witnessed 
things which I cannot explain. I've 
ordered the port closed and all trade 
ships moored until I am sure that my 
city is safe.
 
Atma, the tavernkeeper, has an 
important mission for you. Go see her 
immediately. You'll find her on the 
other side of town.
 
Now, I must return to the palace. I 
apologize, but I can't invite you in. 
Things are... rather a mess right now.

For trade in magic and the like, see 
Drognan or Lysander. Drognan is the 
wisest man I know - without equal in 
magic and ancient lore. Poor Lysander 
is nearly deaf, but he's a reliable potion 
chemist.
 
For travel back west, see Warriv, whom 
you already know.
 
Our own Fara is a fine and honest 
armorer, and she can heal wounds as 
well.
 
Elzix is the Innkeeper and may also 
have some items to trade.
 
Greiz, the mercenary captain I hired to 
secure the gates of Lut Gholein, keeps 
order in town, as well.
 
There are others here, too. I'm sure 
you'll meet most of them. Just look 
around...

You seem very capable, but no offense

When I was very young, Akara told me

Some of my Rogues told me of Deckard 
Cain. They said that he is a man of

never learned how to wage battle 
himself.

Akara has been like a mother to me for

Gheed is a pig. I've been tempted to

desist.

Well, well, I never expected to see an

dark spell, and if you're not careful you 
may fall prey to it as well.

Welcome, outlander, to our glorious

the evil that's driven us from our 
ancestral home.
 
But, know this. Akara may be our 
spiritual leader, but I command the 
Rogues in battle. It will take more than 
just killing a few beasts in the 
wilderness to earn my trust.

stop it. I only pray that you can before

Greetings, hero. I've heard of your

dealing with the Three and their 
minions as you have.
 
My name is Natalya. I am a hunter of 
Evil, part of an ancient Order sworn to 
hunt down corrupted sorcerers.
 
If I could, I would gladly join your quest 
to stop the Three. But I must wait here

will happen, but the danger is greater 
than we can know.
 
Until I receive my orders, I'll assist you

It is good to see you again, hero.
 
Mephisto's defeat is a great victory for 
the Light. I knew that you would 
eventually find your way here. The 
Pandemonium Fortress is the last 
bastion of Heaven's power before the 
Gates of the Burning Hells.
 
This place has been hallowed by the 
blood of thousands of champions of 
the Light, many of whom were mortal, 
like yourself. Now the final battle 
against the Prime Evils draws near... 
and you must face it alone. 
 
I have been forbidden to aid you 
directly, save for a few bits of wisdom. 
For this is the hour of mortal Man's 
triumph...your triumph.
 
May the Light protect you and the 
powers of Heaven shine upon your

I thank you, mortal, for my freedom. 
But I did expect you earlier.
 
I am the Archangel Tyrael. I came here 
to prevent Diablo from freeing his 
brother, Baal. But I have failed. Now, 
Terror and Destruction roam free 
throughout your world.
 
Even now, they head towards the 
Eastern capital of Kurast - to the very 
heart of the Zakarum Temple. There 
they hope to find their eldest brother, 
Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred who was 
imprisoned there ages ago.
 
If the three Prime Evils unite, they will 
be invincible. Though it is unclear as to 
what their aims are, it is certain that 
they must be stopped at all costs.
 
I am broken and the energies that tie 
me to this world are diminishing 
rapidly.
 
You must take up this quest and 
prevent the Three Brothers from 
reuniting. You must cross the sea and 
search for Diablo and Baal in Kurast.
 
Now hurry, mortal... Time is running 
out for all of us!

Greetings, stranger. I'm not surprised 
to see your kind here. Many 
adventurers have traveled this way 
since the recent troubles began.
 
No doubt you've heard about the 
tragedy that befell the town of 
Tristram. Some say that Diablo, the 
Lord of Terror, walks the world again.
 
I don't know if I believe that, but a Dark 
Wanderer did travel this route a few 
weeks ago. He was headed east to the 
mountain pass guarded by the Rogue 
Monastery.
 
Maybe it's nothing, but evil seems to 
have trailed in his wake. You see, 
shortly after the Wanderer went 
through, the Monastery's Gates to the 
pass were closed and strange 
creatures began ravaging the 
countryside.
 
Until it's safer outside the camp and the 
gates are re-opened, I'll remain here 
with my caravan. I hope to leave for 
Lut Gholein before the shadow that fell 
over Tristram consumes us all.  If 
you're still alive then, I'll take you 
along.
 
You should talk to Akara, too. She 
seems to be the leader of this camp. 
Maybe she can tell you more.

Ahh... The lost Horadric Scroll! What a 
fortunate turn of events...
 
As the last living Horadrim, I alone have 
knowledge of its meaning. Now, to read 
the Horadric runes it bears. Hmmm...
 
The Horadric Mages, after binding Baal 
within Tal Rasha, magically sealed off 
his Burial Chamber from the mortal 
realm. Those same Mages also crafted 
fearsome Horadric Staves and imbued 
them with the special power to open 
the Chamber's hidden door.
 
After nearly losing one to the thievery 
of a rogue sorcerer, they divided all 
the Horadric Staves into two parts - 
wooden shaft and metal headpiece - 
hiding them separately to safeguard 
them.
 
The Horadrim foresaw our current 
plight and designed the hiding places 
to reveal themselves to worthy heroes 
like you.
 
Collect both parts of a Horadric Staff 
and unite them using a Horadric Cube. 
Then, you may enter Tal Rasha's Burial 
Chamber.

Welcome to Kurast, young Sorceress. 
Few come willingly to this ancient city 
anymore. I hope you brought your wits 
with you, for sanity is in short supply 
here.
 
My name is Hratli. I am a sorcerer 
skilled in metal work. It'd be a pleasure 
to help you... I don't have many 
customers these days.
 
Though my own magic is only useful for 
making enchanted weapons, I'll bet 
yours will put an end to this terrible 
evil once and for all. May the spirits of 
Skatsim watch over and protect you.
 
As you can see, the populace has been 
brutally decimated by the forces of 
Mephisto. The canals run red with 
blood and demons roam the land.
 
The wretched jungle-hell has already 
reclaimed much of Kurast. The only 
safety you'll find is here at the 
dockside, where a magical warding 
holds the jungle evils at bay... but I 
don't know how long it will last.
 
To make matters worse, the Children of 
Zakarum are in league with the forces 
of Mephisto. The Zakarum have 
concentrated their power in the Temple 
City of Travincal, located within Kurast 
deep in the jungle wilderness.
 
It's true... Their zeal is unmatched. But I 
say the so-called 'Warriors of Light' are 
nothing more than the twisted puppets 
of a hidden hand.

But by all that's still holy, I wish I'd 
never returned to this accursed place. 
This fetid jungle can't be the fair 
Kurast I left behind!
 
I don't know what all this evil is, my 
friend, but it's obvious that you must 
stop it. I only pray that you can before 
the jungle consumes the last vestiges 
of my beloved homeland.
 
If this evil isn't contained, it could 
spread north to your homeland, too. 
Then the whole world would fall under 
the shadow of the Three.

There was an eastern mage... a Vizjerei, 
I believe... who visited me almost a 
year ago. He was very interested in the 
history of this site, and he seemed 
particularly fascinated with the palace 
architecture.
 
I gave him a tour. When he found the 
ancient seals over a passageway in the 
cellar, he became very agitated. He 
asked for some time alone to study 
them, and I granted it.
 
Shortly after, he left with no further 
word and I never saw him again. Odd... 
Don't you think?

The Archangel Tyrael was the one who 
gave the Soulstones to the Horadrim 
two hundred and sixty years ago.
 
It is highly unusual for the forces of 
Heaven to so directly interfere with 
man's destiny, but Tyrael was said to 
act of his own volition. We have never 
been able to discern why.
 
Perhaps, he goes against the consensus 
of Heaven because he doubts our 
ability to defend ourselves, or perhaps, 
he sees more threat than his peers.
 
Where the actions of Hell often seem 
straightforwardly bent on destruction, 
the motives of Heaven are 
unfathomable.
 
Now make haste... Both Diablo and Baal 
must be stopped before they join with 
their brother, Mephisto. If the three 
Prime Evils unite once again, the world 
as we know it will be no more.

Well... I guess I can see why he wanted 
me to stay, though... I'm just glad it 
didn't come to that. Now he tells me to 
wait some more, in case you need to 
get out of here.
 
Well, for you I'll do it. Maybe they'll 
mention me in the epic ballads, eh?

Fara and I have been talking about the 
creature recently. From my studies, I 
have deduced that it is Radament the 
Fallen, an ancient Horadric mummy 
that has for some reason left his tomb 
to prey on mortals.
 
I'm doing some more research now. If 
you check back later, I may have some 
more insight as to his nature.

Thank you, hero, for putting Izual's 
tortured spirit to rest. May the Light 
protect you and the powers of Heaven 
shine upon your path.
 
But, if what you tell me is true, then I 
fear that we have been played for fools 
all along.
 
Izual helped Diablo and his Brothers 
trick me into using the Soulstones 
against them... Now the Stones' powers 
are corrupted.
 
With the combined powers of the 
Soulstones under their control, the 
Prime Evils will be able to turn the 
mortal world into a permanent outpost 
of Hell!

I've just been reading something

Apparently, certain Horadric funereal 
priests altered the bodies of their dead 
mages with magical and surgical 
techniques -- often replacing body 
parts with those of animals.
 
This was thought to augment their 
powers, and raise their status in the

It is good to see you again, hero.
 
Mephisto's defeat is a great victory for 
the Light. I knew that you would 
eventually find your way here. The 
Pandemonium Fortress is the last 
bastion of Heaven's power before the 
Gates of the Burning Hells.
 
This place has been hallowed by the 
blood of thousands of champions of 
the Light, many of whom were mortal, 
like yourself. Now the final battle 
against the Prime Evils draws near... 
and you must face it alone. 
 
I have been forbidden to aid you 
directly, save for a few bits of wisdom. 
For this is the hour of mortal Man's 
triumph...your triumph.
 
May the Light protect you and the 
powers of Heaven shine upon your 
path...

Hello, there. You must be a great 
adventurer to risk coming here.
 
My name's Asheara, and I lead the 
mercenary band of mages known as 
the Iron Wolves. We've been hunting 
down demons in the jungle for months, 
but no matter how many of them we 
kill, they just keep comin'. Seems this 
whole place has been overrun by evil.
 
Rumor has it that you've come here to 
help. If that's true, then I'll let you hire 
some of my mercenaries.
 
But be careful... If you piss them off, 
they can be worse than those monsters 
out in the jungle.

Mephisto, along with Baal, was

Lut Gholein. But imprisoning two of the 
Brothers together was far too

The Horadrim built the Guardian Tower

what was locked within the Tower.

They've made a mockery of the Old

It pains me to waste time with you, so 
I'll get right to the point.
 
There is a very special book which you 
must find for me. It was written long 
ago by a sage known as Lam Esen, who 
studied Skatsimi magic and the effects 
of the Prime Evils on the mortal world. 
The Black Book was lost when the 
Children of Zakarum took over this 
land.
 
Now, you must reclaim it without delay! 
Its knowledge may aid us in this dark 
time ahead.

kill, they just keep comin'. Seems this 
whole place has been overrun by evil.

some of my mercenaries.

There is a dark, tortured soul who was 
trapped within this forsaken realm long 
ago. He was called Izual by mortal 
men, and in ages past he was my most 
trusted Lieutenant.
 
Yet, against my wishes he led an 
ill-fated assault upon the fiery 
Hellforge, itself.
 
Despite his valor and strength, Izual 
was captured by the Prime Evils and 
twisted by their perverse power. They 
forced him to betray his own kind and 
give up Heaven's most guarded 
secrets.
 
He became a corrupt shadow of his 
former self - a fallen angel trusted 
neither by Heaven nor Hell.
 
For his transgressions, Izual's spirit 
was bound within the form of a terrible 
creature which was summoned from 
the Abyss. His maddened spirit has 
resided within that tortured husk for 
many ages now.
 
It seems to me that he has suffered 
long enough. I implore you, hero, find 
Izual and release him from his cruel 
imprisonment.

It is certain that we face the demon 
queen, Andariel, who has corrupted the 
Rogue Sisterhood and defiled their 
ancestral Monastery. This does not 
bode well for us, my friend.
 
Ancient Horadric texts record that 
Andariel and the other Lesser Evils 
once overthrew the three Prime Evils -- 
Diablo, Mephisto and Baal -- banishing 
them from Hell to our world. Here, they 
caused mankind untold anguish and 
suffering before they were finally 
bound within the Soulstones.
 
Andariel's presence here could mean 
that the forces of Hell are once again 
aligned behind Diablo and his Brothers. 
If this is true, then I fear for us all.
 
You must kill her before the Monastery 
becomes a permanent outpost of Hell 
and the way east lost forever.

Well met, noble Paladin. It's been a 
while since I've seen any of your kind in 
the west. It would be an honor to aid 
you in any way that I can.
 
No doubt you've heard about the 
tragedy that befell the town of 
Tristram. Some say that Diablo, the 
Lord of Terror, walks the world again.
 
I don't know if I believe that, but a Dark 
Wanderer did travel this route a few 
weeks ago. He was headed east to the 
mountain pass guarded by the Rogue 
Monastery.
 
Maybe it's nothing, but evil seems to 
have trailed in his wake. You see, 
shortly after the Wanderer went 
through, the Monastery's Gates to the 
pass were closed and strange 
creatures began ravaging the 
countryside.
 
Until it's safer outside the camp and the 
gates are re-opened, I'll remain here 
with my caravan. I hope to leave for 
Lut Gholein before the shadow that fell 
over Tristram consumes us all.  If 
you're still alive then, I'll take you 
along.
 
You should talk to Akara, too. She 
seems to be the leader of this camp. 
Maybe she can tell you more.

Welcome to Kurast, traveler. Few come 
willingly to this ancient city anymore. I 
hope you brought your wits with you, 
for sanity is in short supply here.
 
My name is Hratli. I am a sorcerer 
skilled in metal work. It'd be a pleasure 
to help you... I don't have many 
customers these days.
 
As you can see, the populace has been 
brutally decimated by the forces of 
Mephisto. The canals run red with 
blood and demons roam the land.
 
The wretched jungle-hell has already 
reclaimed much of Kurast. The only 
safety you'll find is here at the 
dockside, where a magical warding 
holds the jungle evils at bay... but I 
don't know how long it will last.
 
To make matters worse, the Children of 
Zakarum are in league with the forces 
of Mephisto. The Zakarum have 
concentrated their power in the Temple 
City of Travincal, located within Kurast 
deep in the jungle wilderness.
 
It's true... Their zeal is unmatched. But I 
say the so-called 'Warriors of Light' are 
nothing more than the twisted puppets 
of a hidden hand.

I've been researching the old records, 
trying to find the location of Tal 
Rasha's Tomb. Though I haven't found 
the Tomb, itself, I may have a good 
lead for you.
 
The great Vizjerei Summoner, Horazon, 
built his Arcane Sanctuary somewhere 
around here. He was a powerful 
spellcaster and kept demons as slaves 
within the Sanctuary. He kept a close 
eye on great events, too -- such as the 
imprisonment of Baal within Tal 
Rasha's Tomb.
 
If you could find Horazon's Sanctuary, 
I'm sure that it would hold some clue 
as to the Tomb's location. Though I 
doubt Horazon is still alive, you must 
proceed with caution. There's no telling 
what could be waiting inside.
 
When I spoke of this with Lord Jerhyn, 
he asked that I send you to him. 
Perhaps he knows of a secret entrance 
or the like.

The time has come to hunt down and 
destroy Diablo, himself.
 
But beware, the Lord of Terror is not to 
be underestimated. He single-handedly 
destroyed the town of Tristram and 
corrupted the last noble hero who tried 
to stop him.
 
This time, you must defeat him for 
good. Only by destroying the Soulstone 
which he carries will his spirit be 
banished forever.
 
Good luck! Though this be our darkest 
hour, it may yet be your greatest 
moment.

The man you describe is probably not 
Horazon.
 
He sounds like the very mage who came 
around here a while ago. He was very 
curious about this palace and seemed 
especially interested in the seal on the 
passageway in the cellar. He left 
shortly after that. I wonder how he got 
down there? The seal was never 
broken...
 
That mage spoke a great deal to 
Drognan. Why don't you ask him about 
it?

the terrible evil that has fallen upon 
our city. Drognan is wise and is sure to

Never forget that your ultimate purpose 
here in Kurast is to destroy Mephisto. 
The ancient Horadrim imprisoned the 
Lord of Hatred inside the Guardian 
Tower that is located within the Temple 
City of Travincal.
 
Know this, friend. The only way to gain 
entry to Mephisto's prison is to destroy 
the artifact known as the Compelling 
Orb.
 
Mephisto used this device to control the 
Zakarum Priests and their followers. 
The Orb can only be destroyed with an 
ancient flail imbued with the spirit of 
the one incorruptible priest.
 
Soon after his imprisonment, Mephisto 
worked his evil corruption on the 
Zakarum priesthood. All were turned to 
his dark ways, save one - Khalim, the 
Que-Hegan of the High Council.
 
Mephisto directed the other Council 
priests to slay and dismember Khalim 
and then scatter his remains across 
the Kingdom. The Priest Sankekur 
succeeded Khalim as Que-Hegan, 
eventually becoming the embodiment of 
Mephisto here on the mortal plane.
 
The corrupted High Council fashioned 
an Orb to control the rest of the 
Zakarum faithful and used their powers 
to hide the lair of their master from 
mortals.
 
Your task is to collect the scattered 
relics of Khalim - his Heart, his Brain, 
and his Eye. Then, using the Horadric 
Cube, transmute Khalim's Flail with his 
relics.
 
Once this is accomplished, you must 
destroy the Compelling Orb with 
Khalim's Will to open the way into the 
corrupt sanctum of Mephisto.

You have quite a treasure there in that 
Horadric Cube. According to Horadric 
lore, the Cube can restore a Horadric 
Staff.
 
To do it - use the Cube as you would a 
scroll. When the Cube opens, place 
both pieces of the Staff into it and use 
the Cube's transmute power.
 
You'll be pleased to know that the Cube 
has other alchemical uses as well...
 
Six gems plus one sword transmute into 
a socketed long sword.
 
You may also transmute two quivers of 
crossbow bolts into one quiver of 
arrows, while two quivers of arrows 
yield one quiver of bolts.
 
I must leave it to you to discover other 
formulae.

Greetings, young Sorceress. It is good 
to see more of your kind at work in the 
world these dark days. In my opinion, 
the world needs more women to fight 
against the great shadow. But I am 
forgetting my manners... 
 
I am Akara, High Priestess of the 
Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye. I 
welcome you, traveler, to our camp, 
but I'm afraid I can offer you but poor 
shelter within these rickety walls.
 
You see, our ancient Sisterhood has 
fallen under a strange curse. The 
mighty Citadel from which we have 
guarded the gates to the East for 
generations, has been corrupted by the 
evil Demoness, Andariel.
 
I still can't believe it... but she turned 
many of our sister Rogues against us 
and drove us from our ancestral home. 
Now the last defenders of the 
Sisterhood are either dead or scattered 
throughout the wilderness.
 
I implore you, stranger: please help us. 
Find a way to lift this terrible curse and 
we will pledge our loyalty to you for all 
time.

Greetings, honored traveler. I am 
Jerhyn, Lord of Lut Gholein, and I bid 
you welcome to my fair port-city. I'm 
glad to know that once again caravans 
are free to travel through the Western 
Pass.
 
For some time now, we have been under 
siege by an evil power that I cannot 
identify. Strange... It all began when a 
Dark Wanderer came this way, looking 
for the Tomb of Tal Rasha. No one 
knows exactly where Tal Rasha, Keeper 
of Baal, is entombed, but it is certain 
to be far out in the desert.
 
Now, my people whisper tales of the 
dead rising from their tombs and 
horrible creatures lurking amongst the 
moonlit dunes. Even I have witnessed 
things which I cannot explain. I've 
ordered the port closed and all trade 
ships moored until I am sure that my 
city is safe.
 
Atma, the tavernkeeper, has an 
important mission for you. Go see her 
immediately. You'll find her on the 
other side of town.
 
Now, I must return to the palace. I 
apologize, but I can't invite you in. 
Things are... rather a mess right now.

Regrettably, I could do nothing to 
prevent the disaster which devastated 
Tristram. It would appear that our 
greatest fears have come to pass. 
Diablo, the Lord of Terror, has once 
again been set loose upon the world!
 
As you know, some time ago Diablo was 
slain beneath Tristram.  And when our 
hero emerged triumphant from the 
labyrinth beneath town, we held a 
grand celebration that lasted several 
days.
 
Yet, as the weeks passed, our hero 
became increasingly aloof. He kept his 
distance from the rest of the townsfolk 
and seemed to lapse into a dark, 
brooding depression. I thought that 
perhaps his ordeal had been so 
disturbing that he simply could not put 
it out of his mind.
 
The hero seemed more tormented every 
passing day. I remember he awoke 
many times -- screaming in the night -- 
always something about 'the East'.
 
One day, he simply left. And shortly 
thereafter Tristram was attacked by 
legions of foul demons. Many were 
slain, and the demons left me to die in 
that cursed cage.
 
I believe now that Tristram's hero was 
that Dark Wanderer who passed this 
way before the Monastery fell.
 
I fear even worse, my friend... I fear 
that Diablo has taken possession of the 
hero who sought to slay him. If true, 
Diablo will become more powerful than 
ever before.
 
You must stop him or all will be lost.

Well, I gave you my word, and brought 
you here as promised.
 
But by all that's still holy, I wish I'd 
never returned to this accursed place.

Kurast I left behind.
 
I don't know what all this evil is, my

stop it. I only pray that you can before 
the jungle consumes the last vestiges

Seekers of the Tomb of Tal Rasha will 
find it through the Portal. But know 
that the glowing glyphs recorded here 
in my Arcane Sanctuary are the signs 
of the six False Tombs.
 
The missing Seventh Sign marks the 
Tomb of Tal Rasha... Of the Horadrim 
he might be called the foremost.
 
It was a shining - but brief - moment for 
the Mage Clans when they set aside 
their differences and worked together 
against the common enemy.
 
The Horadrim relentlessly pursued the 
Three across the desolate Empires of 
the East, and even into the uncharted 
lands of the West, leaving the 
Archangel Tyrael's hands unblemished.
 
Presuming the Three to be vanquished, 
the Horadrim's unstable fellowship 
began to dissipate. Abandoning their 
sacred charge to safeguard the three 
Soulstones, the disparate Mage Clans 
began to squabble amongst each other 
over petty differences.
 
Their conflicts not only dissolved their 
brotherhood, but strengthened the 
Evils which they had buried beneath the 
cold earth.

I thank you, mortal, for my freedom. 
But I did expect you earlier.
 
I am the Archangel Tyrael. I came here 
to prevent Diablo from freeing his 
brother, Baal. But I have failed. Now, 
Terror and Destruction roam free 
throughout your world.
 
Even now, they head towards the 
Eastern capital of Kurast - to the very 
heart of the Zakarum Temple. There 
they hope to find their eldest brother, 
Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred who was 
imprisoned there ages ago.
 
If the three Prime Evils unite, they will 
be invincible. Though it is unclear as to 
what their aims are, it is certain that 
they must be stopped at all costs.
 
I am broken and the energies that tie 
me to this world are diminishing 
rapidly.
 
You must take up this quest and 
prevent the Three Brothers from 
reuniting. You must cross the sea and 
search for Diablo and Baal in Kurast.
 
Now hurry, mortal... Time is running 
out for all of us!

Greetings, hero. I've heard of your

Very few mortals are capable of 
dealing with the Three and their 
minions as you have.
 
My name is Natalya. I am a hunter of 
Evil, part of an ancient Order sworn to 
hunt down corrupted sorcerers.
 
If I could, I would gladly join your quest 
to stop the Three. But I must wait here

will happen, but the danger is greater 
than we can know.
 
Until I receive my orders, I'll assist you

Yes... The man you speak of sounds like 
the mage who came here many months 
ago. He claimed to have fought Diablo 
in the passages beneath Tristram.
 
No doubt the fool wandered into 
Horazon's Sanctuary and lost whatever 
was left of his ravaged mind. He is 
beyond salvation. 
 
It is possible that the fool has been 
possessed by the spirit of Horazon. If 
that's true, then you'd better put an 
end to his tortured existence.
 
Once done, I believe the demons who 
were summoned and imprisoned within

welcome you, traveler, to our camp,

shelter within these rickety walls.
 
You see, our ancient Sisterhood has 
fallen under a strange curse. The 
mighty Citadel from which we have 
guarded the gates to the East for 
generations, has been corrupted by the 
evil Demoness, Andariel.
 
I still can't believe it... but she turned 
many of our sister Rogues against us 
and drove us from our ancestral home. 
Now the last defenders of the 
Sisterhood are either dead or scattered 
throughout the wilderness.
 
I implore you, stranger. Please help us. 
Find a way to lift this terrible curse and 
we will pledge our loyalty to you for all 
time.

from his burial chamber. Given the 
aberrations that have been witnessed 
lately, it comes as no surprise that 
even the ancient guardian spells have 
begun to unravel. Be wary of this as

abomination in the Monastery 
graveyard!
 
Apparently, Andariel is not content to 
take only our living. Blood Raven, one 
of our finest captains in the battle 
against Diablo at Tristram, was also 
one of the first to be corrupted by 
Andariel.
 
Now, you'll find her in the Monastery 
graveyard raising our dead as 
zombies!
 
We cannot abide this defilement! If you 
are truly our ally, you will help us 
destroy her.

Tristram. Many Vizjerei came to fight 
against Diablo, the Lord of Terror.

...And so it came to pass that the 
Countess, who once bathed in the 
rejuvenating blood of a hundred 
virgins, was buried alive... And her 
castle in which so many cruel deeds 
took place fell rapidly into ruin. Rising 
over the buried dungeons in that 
god-forsaken wilderness, a solitary 
tower, like some monument to Evil, is 
all that remains.
 
The Countess' fortune was believed to 
be divided among the clergy, although 
some say that more remains unfound, 
still buried alongside the rotting skulls 
that bear mute witness to the 
inhumanity of the human creature.

When the troubles began here, I allowed 
the terrified Harem guilds to join me 
within the safety of the palace. All was 
fine, until one night...
 
Screams echoed up the stairwells from 
the harem. My guards arrived to find 
the poor girls being slaughtered by a 
merciless band of hell-spawned 
demons. My brave guardsmen tried to 
push the demons back into the 
mysterious rift from which they came.
 
Ever since, my men have fought a losing 
battle. Demons have continued to pour 
through the rift into the palace. 
Ultimately, I hired Greiz and his 
mercenaries to help protect the rest of 
my fair city.
 
Drognan believes that the Arcane 
Sanctuary lies buried underneath this 
palace, since Lut Gholein occupies the 
site of an ancient Vizjerei fortress.
 
My palace is open to you now... Take 
care.

Greetings, stranger. I'm not surprised 
to see your kind here. Many 
adventurers have traveled this way 
since the recent troubles began.
 
No doubt you've heard about the 
tragedy that befell the town of 
Tristram. Some say that Diablo, the 
Lord of Terror, walks the world again.
 
I don't know if I believe that, but a Dark 
Wanderer did travel this route a few 
weeks ago. He was headed east to the 
mountain pass guarded by the Rogue 
Monastery.
 
Maybe it's nothing, but evil seems to 
have trailed in his wake. You see, 
shortly after the Wanderer went 
through, the Monastery's Gates to the 
pass were closed and strange 
creatures began ravaging the 
countryside.
 
Until it's safer outside the camp and the 
gates are re-opened, I'll remain here 
with my caravan. I hope to leave for 
Lut Gholein before the shadow that fell 
over Tristram consumes us all.  If 
you're still alive then, I'll take you 
along.
 
You should talk to Akara, too. She 
seems to be the leader of this camp. 
Maybe she can tell you more.

the palace after the troubles began. No 
one really knows why. Actually, all of 
the town's brothel girls have been 
hiding out in the palace's cellar lately, 
so I assume that the guards have been 
assigned to 'protect them' with their 
lives.

The time has come to hunt down and 
destroy Diablo, himself.
 
But beware, the Lord of Terror is not to 
be underestimated. He single-handedly 
destroyed the town of Tristram and 
corrupted the last noble hero who tried 
to stop him.
 
This time, you must defeat him for 
good. Only by destroying the Soulstone 
which he carries will his spirit be 
banished forever.
 
Good luck! Though this be our darkest 
hour, it may yet be your greatest 
moment.

You have done well, my friend. Your 
courage and valor are an inspiration to 
us all.
 
But now the time has come to face 
those responsible for the evil that has 
stifled our land. You must destroy the 
High Council of Zakarum!
 
Long ago, these elders were charged 
with the stewardship of Mephisto, the 
Lord of Hatred, who was imprisoned 
within the Guardian Tower.
 
Through the generations, these pious 
men slowly fell more and more under 
the sway of Mephisto's malevolent 
power and the Council became an evil 
mockery of its former glory. 
 
It is Mephisto's Hatred that has 
corrupted Zakarum and turned its 
devout followers into paranoid 
fanatics. That is why you must travel 
to the Temple City of Travincal and 
slay the Council.
 
Once they are gone, Mephisto's hold 
over this land and its people will be 
broken!

For trade in magic and the like, see

Elzix is the Innkeeper and may also

Nearly a thousand years ago, Horazon 
rose to the fore of the Vizjerei mage 
clan. Horazon used the knowledge of 
the Vizjerei to summon and control 
demons from Hell.
 
Though a powerful Summoner, Horazon 
feared that the Lords of Hell would 
punish him for enslaving their 
brethren. Thus, the Summoner created 
for himself an Arcane Sanctuary.
 
He believed that his Sanctuary would 
not only protect him from Hell's 
vengeance, but also allow him to 
continue his studies free from the 
ravages of time and disease.
 
Horazon had crafted many wondrous 
scrying devices through which he 
observed the events of the world 
outside. It is certain that he took 
careful study of Tal Rasha's 
imprisonment and recorded the 
location of his forgotten Tomb.
 
The Arcane Sanctuary was believed to 
have been constructed here in Lut 
Gholein. An entrance may be hidden 
somewhere in the palace, as that 
building is very old, and was once a 
Vizjerei fortress.

Never forget that your ultimate purpose 
here in Kurast is to destroy Mephisto. 
The ancient Horadrim imprisoned the 
Lord of Hatred inside the Guardian 
Tower that is located within the Temple 
City of Travincal.
 
Know this, friend. The only way to gain 
entry to Mephisto's prison is to destroy 
the artifact known as the Compelling 
Orb.
 
Mephisto used this device to control the 
Zakarum Priests and their followers. 
The Orb can only be destroyed with an 
ancient flail imbued with the spirit of 
the one incorruptible priest.
 
Soon after his imprisonment, Mephisto 
worked his evil corruption on the 
Zakarum priesthood. All were turned to 
his dark ways, save one - Khalim, the 
Que-Hegan of the High Council.
 
Mephisto directed the other Council 
priests to slay and dismember Khalim 
and then scatter his remains across 
the Kingdom. The Priest Sankekur 
succeeded Khalim as Que-Hegan, 
eventually becoming the embodiment of 
Mephisto here on the mortal plane.
 
The corrupted High Council fashioned 
an Orb to control the rest of the 
Zakarum faithful and used their powers 
to hide the lair of their master from 
mortals.
 
Your task is to collect the scattered 
relics of Khalim - his Heart, his Brain, 
and his Eye. Then, using the Horadric 
Cube, transmute Khalim's Flail with his 
relics.
 
Once this is accomplished, you must 
destroy the Compelling Orb with 
Khalim's Will to open the way into the 
corrupt sanctum of Mephisto.

Regrettably, I could do nothing to 
prevent the disaster which devastated 
Tristram. It would appear that our 
greatest fears have come to pass. 
Diablo, the Lord of Terror, has once 
again been set loose upon the world!
 
As you know, some time ago Diablo was 
slain beneath Tristram.  And when our 
hero emerged triumphant from the 
labyrinth beneath town, we held a 
grand celebration that lasted several 
days.
 
Yet, as the weeks passed, our hero 
became increasingly aloof. He kept his 
distance from the rest of the townsfolk 
and seemed to lapse into a dark, 
brooding depression. I thought that 
perhaps his ordeal had been so 
disturbing that he simply could not put 
it out of his mind.
 
The hero seemed more tormented every 
passing day. I remember he awoke 
many times -- screaming in the night -- 
always something about 'the East'.
 
One day, he simply left. And shortly 
thereafter Tristram was attacked by 
legions of foul demons. Many were 
slain, and the demons left me to die in 
that cursed cage.
 
I believe now that Tristram's hero was 
that Dark Wanderer who passed this 
way before the Monastery fell.
 
I fear even worse, my friend... I fear 
that Diablo has taken possession of the 
hero who sought to slay him. If true, 
Diablo will become more powerful than 
ever before.
 
You must stop him or all will be lost.

dockside, where a magical warding 
holds the jungle evils at bay... but I 
don't know how long it will last.
 
To make matters worse, the Children of 
Zakarum are in league with the forces 
of Mephisto. The Zakarum have 
concentrated their power in the Temple 
City of Travincal, located within Kurast 
deep in the jungle wilderness.

Greetings, young Sorceress. It is good 
to see more of your kind at work in the 
world these dark days. In my opinion, 
the world needs more women to fight 
against the great shadow. But I am 
forgetting my manners... 
 
I am Akara, High Priestess of the 
Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye. I 
welcome you, traveler, to our camp, 
but I'm afraid I can offer you but poor 
shelter within these rickety walls.
 
You see, our ancient Sisterhood has 
fallen under a strange curse. The

guarded the gates to the East for 
generations, has been corrupted by the 
evil Demoness, Andariel.
 
I still can't believe it... but she turned 
many of our sister Rogues against us 
and drove us from our ancestral home. 
Now the last defenders of the 
Sisterhood are either dead or scattered 
throughout the wilderness.
 
I implore you, stranger: please help us. 
Find a way to lift this terrible curse and 
we will pledge our loyalty to you for all 
time.
`: []int{0, 3421}[1:],

It is certain that we face the demon 
queen, Andariel, who has corrupted the 
Rogue Sisterhood and defiled their 
ancestral Monastery. This does not 
bode well for us, my friend.
 
Ancient Horadric texts record that 
Andariel and the other Lesser Evils 
once overthrew the three Prime Evils -- 
Diablo, Mephisto and Baal -- banishing 
them from Hell to our world. Here, they 
caused mankind untold anguish and 
suffering before they were finally 
bound within the Soulstones.
 
Andariel's presence here could mean 
that the forces of Hell are once again 
aligned behind Diablo and his Brothers. 
If this is true, then I fear for us all.
 
You must kill her before the Monastery 
becomes a permanent outpost of Hell 
and the way east lost forever.

...And so it came to pass that the 
Countess, who once bathed in the 
rejuvenating blood of a hundred 
virgins, was buried alive... And her 
castle in which so many cruel deeds 
took place fell rapidly into ruin. Rising 
over the buried dungeons in that 
god-forsaken wilderness, a solitary 
tower, like some monument to Evil, is 
all that remains.

You have done well, my friend. Your 
courage and valor are an inspiration to 
us all.
 
But now the time has come to face 
those responsible for the evil that has 
stifled our land. You must destroy the 
High Council of Zakarum!
 
Long ago, these elders were charged 
with the stewardship of Mephisto, the 
Lord of Hatred, who was imprisoned 
within the Guardian Tower.
 
Through the generations, these pious 
men slowly fell more and more under 
the sway of Mephisto's malevolent 
power and the Council became an evil 
mockery of its former glory. 
 
It is Mephisto's Hatred that has 
corrupted Zakarum and turned its 
devout followers into paranoid 
fanatics. That is why you must travel 
to the Temple City of Travincal and 
slay the Council.
 
Once they are gone, Mephisto's hold 
over this land and its people will be 
broken!

Ahh... The lost Horadric Scroll! What a 
fortunate turn of events...
 
As the last living Horadrim, I alone have 
knowledge of its meaning. Now, to read 
the Horadric runes it bears. Hmmm...
 
The Horadric Mages, after binding Baal 
within Tal Rasha, magically sealed off 
his Burial Chamber from the mortal 
realm. Those same Mages also crafted 
fearsome Horadric Staves and imbued 
them with the special power to open 
the Chamber's hidden door.
 
After nearly losing one to the thievery 
of a rogue sorcerer, they divided all 
the Horadric Staves into two parts - 
wooden shaft and metal headpiece - 
hiding them separately to safeguard 
them.
 
The Horadrim foresaw our current 
plight and designed the hiding places 
to reveal themselves to worthy heroes 
like you.
 
Collect both parts of a Horadric Staff 
and unite them using a Horadric Cube. 
Then, you may enter Tal Rasha's Burial 
Chamber.

he might be called the foremost.
 
It was a shining - but brief - moment for 
the Mage Clans when they set aside 
their differences and worked together 
against the common enemy.
 
The Horadrim relentlessly pursued the 
Three across the desolate Empires of 
the East, and even into the uncharted 
lands of the West, leaving the 
Archangel Tyrael's hands unblemished.
 
Presuming the Three to be vanquished, 
the Horadrim's unstable fellowship 
began to dissipate. Abandoning their 
sacred charge to safeguard the three 
Soulstones, the disparate Mage Clans 
began to squabble amongst each other 
over petty differences.
 
Their conflicts not only dissolved their 
brotherhood, but strengthened the 
Evils which they had buried beneath the 
cold earth.

The Archangel Tyrael was the one who 
gave the Soulstones to the Horadrim 
two hundred and sixty years ago.
 
It is highly unusual for the forces of 
Heaven to so directly interfere with 
man's destiny, but Tyrael was said to 
act of his own volition. We have never 
been able to discern why.
 
Perhaps, he goes against the consensus 
of Heaven because he doubts our 
ability to defend ourselves, or perhaps, 
he sees more threat than his peers.
 
Where the actions of Hell often seem 
straightforwardly bent on destruction, 
the motives of Heaven are 
unfathomable.
 
Now make haste... Both Diablo and Baal 
must be stopped before they join with 
their brother, Mephisto. If the three 
Prime Evils unite once again, the world 
as we know it will be no more.

You have quite a treasure there in that 
Horadric Cube. According to Horadric 
lore, the Cube can restore a Horadric 
Staff.
 
To do it - use the Cube as you would a 
scroll. When the Cube opens, place 
both pieces of the Staff into it and use 
the Cube's transmute power.
 
You'll be pleased to know that the Cube 
has other alchemical uses as well...
 
Six gems plus one sword transmute into 
a socketed long sword.
 
You may also transmute two quivers of 
crossbow bolts into one quiver of 
arrows, while two quivers of arrows 
yield one quiver of bolts.
 
I must leave it to you to discover other

Greetings, honored traveler. I am 
Jerhyn, Lord of Lut Gholein, and I bid 
you welcome to my fair port-city. I'm 
glad to know that once again caravans 
are free to travel through the Western 
Pass.
 
For some time now, we have been under 
siege by an evil power that I cannot 
identify. Strange... It all began when a 
Dark Wanderer came this way, looking 
for the Tomb of Tal Rasha. No one 
knows exactly where Tal Rasha, Keeper 
of Baal, is entombed, but it is certain 
to be far out in the desert.
 
Now, my people whisper tales of the 
dead rising from their tombs and 
horrible creatures lurking amongst the 
moonlit dunes. Even I have witnessed 
things which I cannot explain. I've 
ordered the port closed and all trade 
ships moored until I am sure that my 
city is safe.
 
Atma, the tavernkeeper, has an 
important mission for you. Go see her 
immediately. You'll find her on the 
other side of town.
 
Now, I must return to the palace. I 
apologize, but I can't invite you in. 
Things are... rather a mess right now.
`: []int{0, 3722}[1:],

I've been researching the old records, 
trying to find the location of Tal 
Rasha's Tomb. Though I haven't found 
the Tomb, itself, I may have a good 
lead for you.
 
The great Vizjerei Summoner, Horazon, 
built his Arcane Sanctuary somewhere 
around here. He was a powerful 
spellcaster and kept demons as slaves 
within the Sanctuary. He kept a close 
eye on great events, too -- such as the 
imprisonment of Baal within Tal 
Rasha's Tomb.
 
If you could find Horazon's Sanctuary, 
I'm sure that it would hold some clue 
as to the Tomb's location. Though I 
doubt Horazon is still alive, you must 
proceed with caution. There's no telling 
what could be waiting inside.
 
When I spoke of this with Lord Jerhyn, 
he asked that I send you to him. 
Perhaps he knows of a secret entrance 
or the like.

The Horadric mummies were created to 
protect the tombs, but Radament is far

you venture farther into the desert.

I knew there was great potential in you,

Though my ancestors often struggled 
against the Three Evils and their 
minions, I've always lived a shut-in, 
scholarly life. I'm glad that my wisdom 
aided you.
 
Now, I wish to leave this place. Though 
Heaven's Gates are a marvel to behold, 
I hope I won't have to see them again 
for many, many years.

I thank you, mortal, for my freedom. 
But I did expect you earlier.
 
I am the Archangel Tyrael. I came here 
to prevent Diablo from freeing his 
brother, Baal. But I have failed. Now, 
Terror and Destruction roam free 
throughout your world.
 
Even now, they head towards the 
Eastern capital of Kurast - to the very 
heart of the Zakarum Temple. There 
they hope to find their eldest brother, 
Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred who was 
imprisoned there ages ago.
 
If the three Prime Evils unite, they will 
be invincible. Though it is unclear as to 
what their aims are, it is certain that 
they must be stopped at all costs.
 
I am broken and the energies that tie 
me to this world are diminishing 
rapidly.
 
You must take up this quest and 
prevent the Three Brothers from 
reuniting. You must cross the sea and 
search for Diablo and Baal in Kurast.
 
Now hurry, mortal... Time is running 
out for all of us!

Nearly a thousand years ago, Horazon 
rose to the fore of the Vizjerei mage 
clan. Horazon used the knowledge of 
the Vizjerei to summon and control 
demons from Hell.
 
Though a powerful Summoner, Horazon 
feared that the Lords of Hell would 
punish him for enslaving their 
brethren. Thus, the Summoner created 
for himself an Arcane Sanctuary.
 
He believed that his Sanctuary would 
not only protect him from Hell's 
vengeance, but also allow him to 
continue his studies free from the 
ravages of time and disease.
 
Horazon had crafted many wondrous 
scrying devices through which he 
observed the events of the world 
outside. It is certain that he took 
careful study of Tal Rasha's 
imprisonment and recorded the 
location of his forgotten Tomb.
 
The Arcane Sanctuary was believed to 
have been constructed here in Lut 
Gholein. An entrance may be hidden 
somewhere in the palace, as that 
building is very old, and was once a 
Vizjerei fortress.

Our faith in you was well deserved. But

The Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye has

There is a dark, tortured soul who was 
trapped within this forsaken realm long 
ago. He was called Izual by mortal 
men, and in ages past he was my most 
trusted Lieutenant.
 
Yet, against my wishes he led an 
ill-fated assault upon the fiery 
Hellforge, itself.
 
Despite his valor and strength, Izual 
was captured by the Prime Evils and 
twisted by their perverse power. They 
forced him to betray his own kind and 
give up Heaven's most guarded 
secrets.
 
He became a corrupt shadow of his 
former self - a fallen angel trusted 
neither by Heaven nor Hell.
 
For his transgressions, Izual's spirit 
was bound within the form of a terrible 
creature which was summoned from 
the Abyss. His maddened spirit has 
resided within that tortured husk for 
many ages now.
 
It seems to me that he has suffered 
long enough. I implore you, hero, find 
Izual and release him from his cruel 
imprisonment.
 
Put an end to his guilt and suffering.

Mephisto's defeat is a great victory for

Gates of the Burning Hells.
 
This place has been hallowed by the

like yourself. Now the final battle 
against the Prime Evils draws near... 
and you must face it alone. 
 
I have been forbidden to aid you

Mephisto, along with Baal, was 
originally captured in the desert near 
Lut Gholein. But imprisoning two of the 
Brothers together was far too 
dangerous.
 
The Horadrim built the Guardian Tower

to power in this land, it took over the 
Temple City without paying any heed to 
what was locked within the Tower.
 
And it became their doom.

When the troubles began here, I allowed

Screams echoed up the stairwells from

the poor girls being slaughtered by a 
merciless band of hell-spawned 
demons. My brave guardsmen tried to 
push the demons back into the 
mysterious rift from which they came.
 
Ever since, my men have fought a losing

Ultimately, I hired Greiz and his

Greetings, stranger. I'm not surprised 
to see your kind here. Many 
adventurers have traveled this way 
since the recent troubles began.
 
No doubt you've heard about the 
tragedy that befell the town of 
Tristram. Some say that Diablo, the 
Lord of Terror, walks the world again.
 
I don't know if I believe that, but a Dark 
Wanderer did travel this route a few 
weeks ago. He was headed east to the 
mountain pass guarded by the Rogue 
Monastery.
 
Maybe it's nothing, but evil seems to 
have trailed in his wake. You see, 
shortly after the Wanderer went

countryside.
 
Until it's safer outside the camp and the

Lut Gholein before the shadow that fell 
over Tristram consumes us all.  If

Drognan believes that Diablo is

You must find Diablo and put an end to

our city. Drognan is wise and is sure to

Hi there. I'm Charsi, the blacksmith here 
in camp. It's good to see some strong 
adventurers around here.
 
Many of our Sisters fought bravely 
against Diablo when he first attacked 
the town of Tristram. They came back 
to us true veterans, bearing some 
really powerful items. Seems like their 
victory was short-lived, though... Most 
of them are now corrupted by Andariel.

I've read legends about a sage named 
Ku Y'leh, who studied the mysteries of 
life beyond death.
 
If I remember correctly, his ashes were 
ensconced within a golden statuette. It 
was a very strange tale.
`: []int{0, 2160}[1:],

Tyrael was a fool to have trusted me!
 
You see, it was I who told Diablo and his 
Brothers about the Soulstones and how 
to corrupt them. It was I who helped 
the Prime Evils mastermind their own 
exile to your world.
 
The plan we set in motion so long ago 
cannot be stopped by any mortal 
agency.  Hell, itself, is poised to spill 
forth into your world like a tidal wave 
of blood and nightmares.
 
You and all your kind... are doomed.
`: []int{0, 2931}[1:],
	`47
Yes... The man you speak of sounds like 
the mage who came here many months 
ago. He claimed to have fought Diablo 
in the passages beneath Tristram.
 
No doubt the fool wandered into 
Horazon's Sanctuary and lost whatever 
was left of his ravaged mind. He is 
beyond salvation. 
 
It is possible that the fool has been 
possessed by the spirit of Horazon. If 
that's true, then you'd better put an 
end to his tortured existence.
 
Once done, I believe the demons who 
were summoned and imprisoned within 
the Sanctuary will cease to exist as 
well.

You have done very well. Few could have 
come this far, let alone discover the 
True Tomb of Tal Rasha. Unfortunately, 
I hear that Diablo and Baal have eluded 
your grasp. This is most unfortunate...
 
If you wish to travel East, I have 
authorized Meshif to give you passage 
by sea. I imagine he should be very 
anxious to leave by now.
 
Good luck on your quest, and thank you 
again for saving my beloved city. You

my friend.

I have read much about the enigmatic 
Archangel Tyrael. He was revered in 
Horadrim lore both for his compassion

Horadrim the original Soulstones in

It is clear that Andariel is acting on

The Horadrim used to mummify their

Drognan or Fara would know more

The time has come to hunt down and 
destroy Diablo, himself.
 
But beware, the Lord of Terror is not to 
be underestimated. He single-handedly 
destroyed the town of Tristram and 
corrupted the last noble hero who tried 
to stop him.
 
This time, you must defeat him for 
good. Only by destroying the Soulstone 
which he carries will his spirit be 
banished forever.
 
Good luck! Though this be our darkest 
hour, it may yet be your greatest 
moment.

There was an eastern mage... a Vizjerei, 
I believe... who visited me almost a 
year ago. He was very interested in the 
history of this site, and he seemed 
particularly fascinated with the palace 
architecture.
 
I gave him a tour. When he found the 
ancient seals over a passageway in the 
cellar, he became very agitated. He 
asked for some time alone to study 
them, and I granted it.
 
Shortly after, he left with no further

Apparently, certain Horadric funereal
